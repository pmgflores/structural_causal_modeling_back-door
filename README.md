# Structural Causal Modeling: Back-door Criterion Example

Implementation of the back-door criterion in Structural Causal Modeling (SCM) using simulated data.

## Overview
This code demonstrates an application of back-door criterion for estimating causal effects using the SCM framework. The example follows the model presented in Figure 3 of this [post](http://pablomflores.com/structural-causal-modeling), which shows four different back-door paths between variables X and Y.

## Example Usage
The analysis follows these steps:
1. Plot the Structural Causal Model (SCM)
2. Review possible paths between variables of interest
3. Define control variable sets
4. Simulate data
5. Compute causal effects
